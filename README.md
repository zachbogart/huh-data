Managing work for the [@huh Observable Team](https://observablehq.com/@huh?tab=profile) (a public exploration of Observable). Using this repo for:

- **Tracking progress**: Setting up [issues](https://github.com/zachbogart/huh-data/issues) for work on Observable, either personal TODOs or things suggested by the community. I'm open to suggestions!
- **Data Imports**: Any data wrangling and data storage needed can be included here and read into notebooks. Serving as a place to do (1) more complex wrangling if necessary in stuff like R/Python and (2) accessible data storage, publically available for easy ingestion into Obeservable.
